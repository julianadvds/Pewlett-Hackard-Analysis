# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.
Module 7: Intro to SQL
The raw data was used to explore two questions related to retirment and mentorship. First, the data was used to see summarize how many employees would be retiring, by title. The second question explored in the analysis was to see which employees would be eligible for a mentorship program based on their birth date and current employment status. The analysis was performed using pgAdmin, Postgress and SQL to combine, filter and sort multiple CSV files into usable information.

## Results 
•There are a total of 90,398 employees who are considered in range for the retirement 'silver wave' 

•The title with the most number of employees experiencing the 'silver wave' (retiring) is the Senior Engineer title (29414 employees) followed closely by Senior Staff title (28254 employees) 

•There are 1549 employees who are eligible for mentorship based on their birth year 

•There is a significant gap between the number of employees eligibile for mentorship and the number of roles that will be vacant due to retirement
